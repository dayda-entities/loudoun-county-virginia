processed for cartographic representation at 1:2400 scale. These area features
represent the features that do not fall under the more common layer types such
as roads, buildings, etc. Typical features captured in miscellaneous polys are
cemeteries, quarries, swimming pools, athletic fields, and golf course features
as seen from above and are mapped to National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS).</span></p>
