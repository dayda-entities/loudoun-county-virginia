drainage is used in agricultural and farm plans, stormwater management,
comprehensive planning, floodplain management, and facility planning to provide
a better understanding of what previous drainage was like for a given
area.Â  Soils were originally shown at the scale of 1:15840 and then
redrafted to 1:20000; the data were redrafted a final time to fit Loudoun
County's base map standard of 1:2400. Although the current data rely heavily on
the original soil survey, there have been extensive alterations. The data are
updated as field site inspections or interpretation changes occur. This is a
copy of the drains layer as it exists on 20010208. It is meant to provide the
county with a historical base for drainage.Photogrammetric updates will not
occur to this layer. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a
line feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone
4501, datum NAD83 HARN (vertical datum, if applicable, NAVD88), US Survey foot
units.</span><span style='color:black'></span></p><br /></p>
