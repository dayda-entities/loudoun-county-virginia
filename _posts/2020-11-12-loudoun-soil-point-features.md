Spot points are isolated areas within a symbol that are designated with a symbol because the extent is too small to separate into another mapping unit.  These points or symbols include areas such as sinkholes, springs, stony areas, wet spots, etc.</p><p><b>Purpose: </b>As a subset of the soils information, the spot points layer should be used in conjunction with the other soils layers.  Spot points show specific areas that require special interpretation and/or land use which differs from the surrounding map unit.</p><p><b>Supplemental Information: </b>Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a point feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN (vertical datum, if applicable, NAVD88), US Survey foot units.</p><p><b>Maintenance and Update Frequency: </b>As needed</p><p><b>Completeness Report: </b>Features may have been eliminated or generalized due to scale and intended use.  To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data.</p><p><b>Soil Point Features: </b>SP =   Unknown; BPI =   Borrow pit; CLA =   Clay spot; GRA =   Gravely spot; MDL =   Made Land; ROC =   Rock; SAN =   Sandy spot; SNK =   Sink hole; SPR =   Spring; SSS =   Soil sample spot; STN =   Stoney spot; TEC =   Terrace capping; WET =   Wet spot</p><p><b>Data Owner: </b>Department of Building and Development</p></div>
