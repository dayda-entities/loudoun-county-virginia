Redrawing the boundaries ensures equal representation of the population. Each election district is required to have a similar population count, generally within +/- 5% of the equalized decennial census population of the County, which is calculated using the Loudoun County decennial Census population divided by the number of districts. Loudoun County has eight districts, and also elects the Board Chairman at-large.</span>
