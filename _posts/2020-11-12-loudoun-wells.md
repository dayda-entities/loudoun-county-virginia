It also provides additional attribute information on Status, Depth, etc.</p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'>The original water well &amp; pollution source layer was developed in 1988 by the Countyâ€™s Environmental Health Department. Records were entered into a database from 40 years of historical paper files, which exhibited a wide range of completeness and accuracy. This was an on-going process until early 1996 at which time the layer was no longer maintained. In late 2000, the Department of Building and Development began a process of updating the layer by entering data from the permit files, which had accumulated since 1996.</p>
