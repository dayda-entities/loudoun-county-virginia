census geography hierarchy of tracts, block groups, and blocks. The three
census geographies nest to each other, forming a hierarchy of census tract,
followed by block groups, and then blocks, with blocks being the smallest. A
census block group is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract
that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block numbers within
a census tract.</span></p>

Loudoun County Government during the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical
Areas Program for the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census block layer has been
modified from the Census Bureau's Tiger line file. Users should be aware that
the Census's Tiger line data is devised from a mix of national and local GIS
data sets. When the Tiger line data is overlaid with Loudoun County
Government's detailed GIS layers it can be determined that the Census Bureau's
Tiger line boundaries in some cases are slightly off from the actual location
of the physical features, natural features, and governmental units such as town
boundaries that they are designated to follow. The 2010 Loudoun census block
group layer was generated by Loudoun County so that the block group boundaries
would overlay with the features in Loudoun County's GIS data sets that the
boundary are designated to follow.</span></p>
