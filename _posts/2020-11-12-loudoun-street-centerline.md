Both address range and a link to street names are included as data attributes. The current data is collected from recorded plats in DXF format or is digitized from plats. The data covers the entire County as well as the incorporated Towns. Purpose: The street centerline coverage was originally developed to support addressing. Fire &amp; Rescue Services and the Sheriff's Office use the address range information for Emergency 911 dispatching; it is also used to update U.S. Census Bureau Tiger data in support of the decennial census. Supplemental Information: Centerline data are maintained from plats and site plans prepared by engineering and surveying firms. Although street centerline is the most current of the County's street data, deviation in construction after plat submittal and recordation may cause centerline to differ from similar County layer, road casing. Centerline contains the most current data; road casing is spatially more accurate because it is updated photogrammetrically. These data are not intended to be used for local surveys or at a scale larger than 1:2400. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: Data is updated on a daily basis. Completeness Report: Features may have been eliminated or generalized due to scale and intended use. To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data.
