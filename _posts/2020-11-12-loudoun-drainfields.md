Drain fields are independent, private sewage disposal systems denoted with PSSD. Cemeteries are included as a potential groundwater and soil pollution source. Within this data set, the majority of wells are individual potable water wells and the majority of pollution sources are individual sewage disposal (septic/drain field) systems. Other types of wells and pollution sources, like cemeteries, also exist in the data and are listed and explained in the data dictionary. Note that all identified pollution sources are not necessarily causing pollution but, rather, can be simply a potential source of pollution. Information for wells comes primarily from State Groundwater Well Completion (GW2) forms completed by well drilling contractors and varies in accuracy and completeness. Information for pollution sources comes primarily from the Health Department permitting and inspection process and/or date of discovery from field verification.</span>
