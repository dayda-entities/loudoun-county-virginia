Virginia Senate districts represent the area that each elected member of the Virginia Senate represents.  The Senate districts are revised and adopted by the Commonwealth of Virginia each decade.  The Commonwealth of Virginia redraws its House districts based of the results of the most recent decennial census, in this case the 2010 Census.  

This Senate district plan, HB 5005, was signed by the Governor of Virginia on April 29, 2011 &amp; approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on June 17, 2011.  The 2011 election districts are effective immediately upon adoption. 

Any maps showing the Virginia Senate districts produced prior to the Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Justice approval should include the following statement: &quot;Plan signed by the Virginia governor on April 29, 2011 &amp; approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on June 17, 2011.
