The stormwater pipes and culverts data is comprised of lines. The pipes and culverts are the man-made structures composed of concrete, metal and plastic used to convey stormwater from catch basins and ponds to the natural drainage ways and swales that eventually discharge to creeks and streams. The pipes and culverts data was collected primarily in eastern Loudoun in the more urbanized portions of the County and was collected in the field using GPS instrumentation. At least 95% of the locational data for the pipes and culverts is accurate to within 1 meter or less. Pipes and culverts are named and digitized in the direction of water flow.
