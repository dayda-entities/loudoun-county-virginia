The stormwater structures data is comprised of points (inlets, manholes, pipe ends, culvert ends, and control devices). The pipe and culvert point structures, typically one at each end of the pipe/culvert line, include the stormwater infrastructure where there is a change in pipe direction. The data was collected primarily in eastern Loudoun in the more urbanized areas of the County. The data was collected in the field using GPS so that at least 95% of data is accurate to less than 3.28 ft. (1 m).
