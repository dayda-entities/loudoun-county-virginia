Countyâ€™s Metrorail station service districts were established on December 5,
2012 to fund the construction and maintenance of the stations, rail line, and
rail related facilities and services. All parcels in the districts, residential
and commercial, have a special property tax rate for funding of the rail. Tax
collection for the districts is for Tax Year 2013 and future years.</span><span style='color:black'></span></p>
