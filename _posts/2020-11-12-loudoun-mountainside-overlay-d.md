Mountainside classifications are based upon the following criteria: critical elevation, debris flow (slippage) potential, groundwater recharge, soils, slope, and forest values. Critical elevation areas are determined from the County's digital topography, soil and slope values are based upon data, the County's soil layer, and forested areas are based upon the digital forest data. This original MDOD replaces the voided layer implemented in 2003 (see disclaimer above).</p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'><b>Purpose:</b></p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'>The Mountainside Development Overlay District is a zoning overlay district (see Section 4-1600 of the 1993 Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance) and regulates development on the mountainsides of the County. Mountainside data should be used for general planning purposes only and is not intended for use in delineating specific use or suitability of soils for a particular site. Areas prone to debris flow (slippage) may not be accurately delineated. The Department of Building and Development is responsible for final clearance and interpretation on zoning/building permits and land development applications for the Mountainside Development Overlay District.</p>
