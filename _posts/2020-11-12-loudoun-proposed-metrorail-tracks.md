These track data are for illustrative purposes only. The 11.5 mile Phase 2
track data and the maintenance track extension were extracted from the latest
proposed data provided by MWAA to the Loudoun County Office of Mapping and
Geographic Information on April 25, 2012. These data reflect the extension of
the Silver Line from Wiehle Ave in Reston, VA to west of Ashburn, VA and, when
completed, will become part of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
(WMATA) Metrorail system.</span><span style='color:black'></span></p>
