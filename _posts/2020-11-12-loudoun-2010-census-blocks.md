The 2010 Census block boundaries were used for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes for the 2010 Decennial Census. Census blocks are the smallest geographic area for publishing data from the decennial Census.</p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'>The 2010 Census block layer has been modified from the Census Bureau's Tiger line file. Users should be aware that the Census's Tiger line data is devised from a mix of national and local GIS data sets. When the Tiger line data is overlaid with Loudoun County Government's detailed GIS layers it can be determined that the Census Bureau's Tiger line boundaries in some cases are slightly off from the actual location of the physical features, natural features, and governmental units such as town boundaries that they are designated to follow. The 2010 Loudoun Census block layer was generated by Loudoun County so that the block boundaries would overlay with the features in Loudoun County's GIS data sets that the boundary are designated to follow.</p>
