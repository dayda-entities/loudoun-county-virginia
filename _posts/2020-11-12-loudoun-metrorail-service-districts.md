&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;color:#4C4C4C;background:white'>At the July 3, 2012
Loudoun Board of Supervisor's Business Meeting, the Board agreed to be a
funding partner with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and
Fairfax County for the Phase II extension of Metrorail to Dulles Airport and
Ashburn. Loudoun Countyâ€™s rail service districts were established on December
5, 2012 to fund the construction and maintenance of the stations, rail line,
and rail related facilities and services. All parcels in the districts,
residential and commercial, have a special property tax rate for funding of the
rail. Tax collection for the districts is for Tax Year 2013 and future
years.The boundaries of the Metrorail Service District were defined using
physical features such as major roads and streams within two miles of stations.
In some cases, parcel boundaries were used to develop the tax district
boundary. The Route 606/Airport and Route 772 station service districts were
defined using half-mile radii around the four proposed rail stations in or near
Loudoun County: 1) Route 772, 2) Route 606, 3) Dulles Airport, and 4) Route 28.
These radii were used as approximate guidelines. At the time the districts were
established, the districts encompassed primarily commercial land. Only a few
existing residential units were included within these districts at the time the
districts were established.**The features the boundaries follow may have been
generalized due to scale and intended use.**</span></p></div>
