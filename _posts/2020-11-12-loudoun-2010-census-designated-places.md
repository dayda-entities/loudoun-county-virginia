CDPs are delineated to provide data for concentrations of population in unincorporated communities that are well-known, distinct, closely settled, and identifiable by name and have a mix of residential, commercial, and retail or will soon have a mix.</p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'>This 2010 CDP GIS layer's boundaries are based on the U.S. Census Bureau Census 2010 TIGER/Line files. The boundaries are an extract of aerial photography and cartographic information, such as roads and streams, from the Loudoun County GIS system. CDP's are bounded on all sides by visible features, such as roads, streams, lakes, power lines, and railroad tracks, and/or by non-visible boundaries such as town, county, and neighborhood subdivision boundaries, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.</p>
