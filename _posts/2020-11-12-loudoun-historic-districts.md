<div><a href='https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/County%20historic%20districts.htm' target='_blank'>More Metadata</a><br /></div>The data set identifies the six county-administered Historic and Cultural Conservation District areas within Loudoun County. 

The County-designated districts include six Historic and Cultural Conservation Districts (Aldie, Bluemont, Goose Creek, Oatlands, Taylorstown, and Waterford) and one Historic Roadways District (Beaverdam Creek). The Historic Districts are Zoning Overlay Districts and are subject to Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance, Article VI, Section 6-1800, Designation of Historic Districts and Section 6-1900, Permits in Historic Districts. The Beaverdam Creek Historic Roadways District differs from the other districts, as the Roadways District only includes the part of the parcel located within a 35-foot buffer in each direction from the centerline of a designated roadway. The Planning Department administers the County's Historic Districts Program.<div><br /></div>
