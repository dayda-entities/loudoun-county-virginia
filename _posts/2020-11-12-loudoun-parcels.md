Data were compiled from plats and deeds recorded at the Clerk of the Court and from historic tax maps. Source material was digitized or the coordinates were entered into the database via ARC/INFO Coordinate Geometry (COGO). Digital data from engineering companies has also been incorporated for newer subdivisions. A MCPI number is used to identify each parcel, which is a unique ID number further explained below. Purpose: Parcels are used to support a variety of services including assessment, permitting, subdivision review, planning, zoning, and economic development. Parcel data were initially developed to replace existing tax maps. As a result, there are parcel polygons digitized from tax maps that do not represent land parcels but are taxable entities such as leaseholds or easements. Supplemental Information: Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: Parcels are updated on an hourly basis from recorded deeds and plats. Depending on volume and date of receipt of recordation information, data may be updated 2-3 weeks following recordation. Completeness Report: Features may have been eliminated or generalized due to scale and intended use. To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data. MCPI: 9 digit unique parcel ID that is a combination of: MAP, CELL, and PARCEL. MAP: 3 digit map number (001-701) corresponding with map tile index. CELL: 2 digit map grid location of parcel center; the grid is comprised of 1000 by 1000 ft grid cells numbered as rows and columns (Columns numbered &gt; 5 6 7 8 9 0; Rows numbered &gt; 1 2 3 4). PARCEL: 4 digit location of polygon center based on the 1927 Virginia State Plane coordinate grid where an easting and northing measurement is taken. example: 6654 from: E 2229668 N475545. The MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values of a parcel do not change when a parcel is altered by a boundary line adjustment or becomes residue from a subdivision. The MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values may therefore be inconsistent with the location of polygon center. MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values have been manually altered for some parcels to agree with other databases; as a result, not all parcels can be located by the MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values.
