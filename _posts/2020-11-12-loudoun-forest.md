tracts is a base map data layer derived by automated processes and processed
for cartographic representation at 1:2400 scale. The polygon features represent
the areas of forest or scrub cover as seen from above and are mapped to
National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Forest is used by both the private
and public sectors for comprehensive planning, facility planning, preservation
projects, site design and land cover analysis.</span><span style='font-size:

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black'>Data are stored in the
corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class. The coordinate system
is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN, Vertical datum,
NAVD88, US Survey foot units. OMAGI updates all base map data via a
photogrammetric process, using aerial imagery that is flown yearly in phases. A
different portion of the County is updated each year with the base map
maintenance services contract, depending upon development patterns and update
funding. See &quot;Lineage&quot; section for the list of extents for each Phase
area, which are listed as “Data Sources”. The field “UPD_DATE” indicates the
date a feature was last re-mapped, although it may have been reviewed for
changes more recently. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
