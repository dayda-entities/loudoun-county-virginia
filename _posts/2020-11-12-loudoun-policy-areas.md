Each policy area has a preferred development pattern that is distinct and will determine the location of public infrastructure and facilities over the next 20 years. Eastern Loudoun largely constitutes the Suburban Policy Area and is in turn made up of four distinct communities namely, Ashburn, Sterling, Potomac and the Dulles Communities. The western two-thirds of the County constitutes the Rural Policy Area, promoting rural economy uses and limited residential development. The Transition Policy Area separates the two and is envisioned to support distinct development patterns that will serve as spatial and visual transitions between the Suburban and Rural Policy Areas. A Joint Land Management Area (JLMA) is an area surrounding an incorporated town that is planned to eventually be served by town water and sewer. These areas are governed by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, but are anticipated to be annexed by the towns and are jointly planned by the County and the towns. Data are compiled from the Loudoun County General Plan and subsequent Area Management Plans.</p><p></p></span>
