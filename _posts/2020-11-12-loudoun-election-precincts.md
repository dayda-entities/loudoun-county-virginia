These precinct boundaries were last reviewed, updated, and adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 15, 2011. The Department of Justice subsequently approved the precincts. Precincts are wholly contained within the Loudoun Board of Supervisors' election districts. The first digit of the three digit PR_Number (precinct number) identifies the precinct's local BOS election district.</span><div><br /></div>
