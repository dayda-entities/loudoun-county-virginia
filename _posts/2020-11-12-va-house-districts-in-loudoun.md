<div><a href='https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/Virginia%20house%20districts%202011.htm' target='_blank'>More Metadata</a><br /></div>This layer represents the Virginia House districts that are within Loudoun County.  Virginia House districts represent the area that each elected member of the Virginia House represents.  The House districts are revised and adopted by the Commonwealth of Virginia each decade.  The Commonwealth of Virginia redraws its House districts based of the results of the most recent decennial census, in this case the 2010 Census.  

This House district plan, referred to as HB 5005, was signed by the Governor of Virginia on April 29, 2011 &amp; approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on June 17, 2011.  The 2011 election districts are effective immediately upon adoption.  

Any maps showing the Virginia House districts produced prior to the Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Justice approval should include the following statement: &quot;Plan signed by the Virginia governor on April 29, 2011 &amp; approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on June 17, 2011.
