<div><a href='https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/Water.html' target='_blank'>More Metadata</a><br /></div><div><br /></div>Water Bodies are used for water supply planning, the administration of related zoning restrictions, and to locate water supplies in rural areas for fighting fires.<em>Supplemental_Information:</em>Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN, Vertical datum, NAVD88, US Survey foot units. OMAGI updates all base map data via a photogrammetric process, using aerial imagery that is flown yearly in phases. A different portion of the County is updated each year with the base map maintenance services contract, depending upon development patterns and update funding. See &quot;Lineage&quot; section for the list of extents for each Phase area, which are listed as “Data Sources”. The field “UPD_DATE” indicates the date a feature was last re-mapped, although it may have been reviewed for changes more recently. For a map of the most recent reviews and updates within the county, please see <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/omagi/8371423446/'>&lt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/omagi/8371423446/&gt;</a>
