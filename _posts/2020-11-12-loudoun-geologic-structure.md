background:white'>&quot;Structure&quot; is one of four layers which
collectively describe the subsurface geologic formation, structural geology and
surficial deposits. &quot;Structure&quot; is the point file of geologic strike
and dip as determined from outcrops. The geology of Loudoun County, Virginia, was
mapped in 1988 through 1991 under a cooperative agreement between the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) and the Loudoun County Department of Environmental
Resources. This geologic map was compiled in 1993 from a series of detailed
published and unpublished field investigations at scales of 1:12,000 and
1:24,000. Some of these same data were compiled as a digital geologic map at
1:100,000 scale (Burton and others, 1992a) and were the basis for a
cost-benefit analysis of the societal value of geologic maps (Bernknopf and
others, 1993). The data was later revised and published by USGS in the Open
File Report, MAP OF-99-150, GEOLOGIC MAP OF LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA By Scott
Southworth, W.C. Burton, J.S. Schindler, and A.J. Froelich1 with contributions
on the geology of the Piedmont province by A.A. Drake, Jr., and R.E. Weems and
an aeromagnetic survey by D.L. Daniels, W.F. Hanna, and R.E. Bracken.</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif'></span></p><br /></p></div>
