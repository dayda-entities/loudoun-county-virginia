<p><a href='https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/cemeteries.html' target='_blank'>More Metadata</a><br /></p><p>Historic cemeteries and burial grounds are fragile, tangible heritage resources that connect residents and visitors to their Loudoun roots. As development projects have been approved in the county over the years, these resources have been impacted. In some cases they have been inadvertently destroyed. In other cases, graves have been moved to other burial locations to make way for construction projects. While the County has kept some records of known cemeteries and burial grounds, there has never been a systematic effort to consolidate locational information into a publicly accessible database.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 2018, the Board of Supervisors (BOS) directed County staff to create such a database that could provide residents, researchers, and developers with cemetery and burial ground locations as a means of ensuring that these resources are protected and preserved.
</p>

<p><b>Purpose: </b>This dataset contains historic cemetery locations as point feature and basic cemetery attributes.</p>

<p><b>Supplemental Information: </b>Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a point feature class.  The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN.</p>

<p><b>Maintenance and Update Frequency: </b>As Needed</p>

<p><b>Completeness Report: </b>To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data.</p>

<p>The historic cemetery data are based on field reports which have been submitted by many and varied individuals, groups, institutions, and cultural resource firms. Submissions to the Site File are sometimes accepted from amateurs as well as professionals. The locations are only as accurate as the locational information submitted to the Site File by the site recorder. The accuracy of submitted information cannot always be verified. The absence of a cultural resource in this data layer does not preclude the existence of an unrecorded resource in the field. The cemeteries recorded at the Site File represent only a fraction of the historic cemeteries present statewide.</p>

<p>The locations of archaeological sites, historic structures, unmarked human burials, cemeteries, and other cultural features contained in this and other Site File data layers are for resource management, law enforcement, and research purposes only.</p>

<p>Cemeteries located on private property have restricted access to specific individuals (such as family members or descendants of those buried there) with advanced notice to the landowner, who may designate the frequency of access, hours and duration of access, and the access route.</p>
