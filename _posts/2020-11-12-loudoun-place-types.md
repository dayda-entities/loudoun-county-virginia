<div><a href='https://logis.loudoun.gov/metadata/placetypes.html' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>More Metadata</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size:16px;'>Â </span><br /></div><div><br /></div>This feature class contains the basic expected land uses, or place types, for specific areas for all of Loudoun County. The place type approach concentrates on the context of any area instead of typical land use categories and corresponding specific uses. Each place type category defines the basis expected land use for an area, but also the preferred development patterns, streetscapes, and design features to make each area visually distinctive and functional. Place types also provide greater flexibility in development than the previous planned land use approach.<div><br /></div><div>This purpose of this feature class is to reference the planned place types, or expected land uses in certain areas, as reflected by the Loudoun County 2019 Comprehensive Plan, which was adopted on June 20, 2019. The data is used extensively by both the Department of Planning, Building and Development but is administered by the Department of Planning. This place type layer is to be used in place of the previous planned land use layer that was retired with the adoption of the 2019 Comprehensive Plan.<br /></div>
