The VCOD is a component of the Official Zoning Ordinance adopted by the Board of Supervisors on January 6, 2003, effective on January 7, 2003, and the Zoning Ordinance further amended on December 6, 2006, and is shown on the Official Loudoun County, VA Zoning Map. The VCOD layer is owned and maintained by Loudoun County, Virginia Department of Building and Development.</p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'><b>Purpose:</b></p><p style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;'>The VCOD is established to recognize the development patterns existing in traditional villages, considered to be valuable heritage resources, and to encourage the retention and reinforcement of the pattern, character and visual identity of the individual village. The data are used extensively for taxation, subdivision review, permitting, and planning. Although the feature class represents the VCOD, a determination should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify whether a particular property is located within the VCOD.</p>
